OMG, dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Another Simple Favor and like, what did I even just see? You know what I mean? It’s like, I can’t tell if I should be laughing or worried about the state of my brain. 😂 

So, first off, Anna Kendrick is just out here doing her awkward yet somehow ridiculously charming thing as usual. I was like, Girl, are you okay? but also rooting for her, like, you go, do your crazy investigating thing! Seriously, what even was Blake Lively’s character up to? Her outfits alone deserve an Oscar or something.

> Anyway, it was one of those flicks you don't think too hard about, you know? Just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   on a whim, and like, here I am, trying to process if I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 a thriller or a comedy. Or maybe both? Lol, I’m shook. 🤯

Also, side note, why does every   these days have to have at least one plot twist that makes you feel like you’re the clueless one? Like, am I supposed to see that coming or just pretend I did when it all unfolds? Hahaha.

Dude, I gotta say, I loved that awkward dynamic they had. It made me laugh and cringe at the same time—reminded me of how I act at those dreaded family reunions. 😂 So many awkward vibes!

// Here’s a line of code because why not: int main(void) { return 0; }

So yeah, definitely 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   when you get a chance. It’s a ride, man, trust me. 😎 Catch ya later!
